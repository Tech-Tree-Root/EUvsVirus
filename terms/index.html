            <p>
                EUvsVirus is the mission-driven initiative that brought together developers, designers, creatives, and entrepreneurs to create extremely efficient responses in our fight against the unexpected and world-changing challenges imposed by coronavirus. This program was sponsored and initiated by the European Commission and several international entities, including Tech Tree Root, the national hackathon organization of the United States.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this Agreement, “Events” refers to the EUvsVirus events that are organized by an EUvsVirus entity and to which you applied or registered for participation.

                changes. Additionally, you may be reading these terms on a service provided by a third party, in this
                case the version of terms may be outdated, to make sure, the latest version can always be found on the
                Websites.
